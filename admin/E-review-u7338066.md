Component: task 12 [getAllViablePaths()](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7447030/comp1110-ass2/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/ass2/Arboretum.java#L1125-1196) function in Arboretum class

### Comments 

Natasha has done a great job in implementing the function using limit amount of codes. It is surprising to see her make
use of the Arbor class and the enum class Species that have been created in the game folder. She creates methods inside
the Arbor class so that she can make use of them and code in shorter and clearer way. It would also benefit other team
members in doing other tasks. It would also be easier to repair and add functionality based on the class.

The classes and methods used are properly named and easily understand. Each method does a simple job, and it does not
confuse me understanding the codes. The variables are also well named and the naming of the helper function is good as
well.

The style of the code is very good, comments are made appropriately, and Natasha leaves a space between every step of
coding, which is definitely user-friendly.
